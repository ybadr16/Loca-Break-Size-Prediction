# Deep Learning Approach to LOCA break size prediction using tensorflow and keras

## Overview

This repository contains the code, data, and documentation for me and my colleagues graduation project. The goal of this project is to develop a deep learning model that
estimates the break size of a loss of coolant accident (LOCA) by inputting post-loca parameters to the model.
