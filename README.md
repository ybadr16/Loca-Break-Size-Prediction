[![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/842477685.svg)](https://zenodo.org/doi/10.5281/zenodo.13321718)

## Overview

This repository contains the code, data, and documentation for me and my colleagues graduation project. The goal of this project is to develop a deep learning model that
estimates the break size of a loss of coolant accident (LOCA) by inputting post-loca parameters to the model.

## Contents

- **/src/**: Source code files
- **/data/**: Data used in this project
- **/docs/**: Dissertation, Reports and Images
- **/results/**: Contains the outputs discussed in the dissertation

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

The requirements file should be enough for all the necessary libraries, use 'pip instasll -r requirements.txt'

## Usage

Running main.py should be enough to reproduce the results provided in the results folder.
